A simple server that serves webcam pictures to a website.

I first built the button circuit board then completed the blink and helloYou tutorials. I then edited the distant-pictures' public/client.js file so that the user can snap a picture using the button.

npm Installation
To first try my hand at downloading npm packages, I downloaded the jquery library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery). The download completed successfully after 9.4 seconds.

In an attempt to implement Node OpenCV functionality, I used npm to install a large library "opencv4nodejs." npm stopped responding at multiple installation attempts, including the one that was eventually successful.
